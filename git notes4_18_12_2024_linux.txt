git restore --staged <file> - is used to unstage a file, that is remove a file from the staging area.(applied since v2.23)

git reset HEAD <file> - also unstages the file but is older than the command above.


QUESTION - WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BTW THE FIRST AND SECOND COMMAND (i.e. HEAD and restore)?
QUESTION 2 - WHAT DOES THE COMMAND "cat" DO?
QUESTION 3 - WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GIT AND GITHUB?

HOW TO REVERT TO LAST COMMIT IN git
* git restore <file> - takes your modified file back to the previous commit. Use this command with caution, cause when the file is reverted back to a previous commit, you can't get the changes back (that is the reverted/deleted code).
