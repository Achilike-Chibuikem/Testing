git status - tells you if you are already in a git project(folder) or not.

git init - initialises a git repository.

touch <fileName.extention> - creates an empty file in the git repository.

git config --global --add safe.directory <directoryName> - adds a repository to the safe.directory list so that repository can be recognised as safe.

AREAS TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN WORKING WITH GIT.
* working directory - this is where your project files are created.

* staging area - a place where you can prepare changes before moving your files to the repository.

* repository - where snapshots of your projects are saved.

THE GIT ADD COMMAND
* It is used to add changes in the working area in the staging area. That is if you are about to commit it to the repository.

* to add individual files, you say git add fileName.extension.

* git add . - adds all changes that has been made.

* git add -u/--update - to stage any deleted item.

* git add *.txt - to stage any file with the same extension.

git rm --cached <file> - to unstage a file. That is to remove it from the staging area.

git checkout -- <file> - deletes current changes and resets the file to the last committed state.

git log - to view the history of your git repository.

git diff - shows you the difference between the files in the working area and the files that are already in the repository(previous and current snapshot). That is, it shoews what you added and removed from the file that is staged.

git diff <commit1> <commit2> - to view the difference between two different commits.

git commit -a - Commits all modified or deleted files that are already being tracked by Git (i.e., files that have been previously added to the repository). It automatically stages these changes before committing, so you don't have to run git add for those files.
